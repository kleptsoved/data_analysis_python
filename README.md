# Data Analysis & Visualization with Python

## Overview
This repository contains a structured workflow for **data preprocessing, merging, and visualization** using Python. It demonstrates best practices in **data cleaning, integration, and exploratory data analysis (EDA)**.

The goal of this repository is to:
- Showcase **efficient data processing techniques**.
- Provide **clear, well-documented Jupyter notebooks** for easy understanding.
- Help businesses make **data-driven decisions** based on insights.

## 📁 Repository Structure

This repository consists of three core notebooks:

### 📌 **1. Data Cleaning**
**Notebook:** [`01_data_cleaning.ipynb`](./01_data_cleaning.ipynb)  
- Handling **missing values** through imputation & removal.
- Standardizing **column names** for better data consistency.
- Identifying and removing **duplicate records**.
- Formatting **numerical and categorical variables**.

**Key Takeaways:**  
By ensuring clean and structured data, this step lays the foundation for meaningful analysis.

### 📌 **2. Data Merging**
**Notebook:** [`02_data_merging.ipynb`](./02_data_merging.ipynb)  
- Understanding different **join types** (`inner`, `left`, `right`, `outer`).
- Merging datasets based on **common keys**.
- Handling **duplicate records** post-merge.
- Checking for **data inconsistencies** after merging.

**Key Takeaways:**  
Successful data integration ensures that relevant information is combined correctly, allowing for deeper analysis.

### 📌 **3. Data Visualization**
**Notebook:** [`03_data_visualization.ipynb`](./03_data_visualization.ipynb)  
- Creating **histograms** to analyze distributions.
- Using **scatter plots** to explore relationships between variables.
- Performing **time-series analysis** to identify patterns.

**Key Insights:**  
- Peak customer activity occurs between **X AM and Y PM**.  
- Scatter plot trends reveal **periods of increased purchasing behavior**.  
- Time-series trends indicate **seasonal demand fluctuations**.
